Repo just for me to document my adventures in sharpening my C/Assembly programming. Exercises are taken from github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C. Each exercise will contain 3 versions:
   * Linux version, just uses the standard C library (if possible)
   * Windows version using the Win32 API
   * Assembly version calling the standard C library functions
